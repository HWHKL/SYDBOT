# Luna

Luna is a tool that helps to query the mobile game *Princess Connect Re: Dive!*'s Clan Battle rank and the score line. 

There is a similar project called [Kyouka](https://kengxxiao.github.io/Kyouka/), but it only serves for the Bilibili official server. This project **serves for the channel server**. Since the number of players in channel server are much smaller, the project's name is from the game's another character Luna (which is known as "xcw with no friends").

The project now is only a plugin of Nonebot because I don't have much time and I don't know well of the database and web.  It supports query the clan battle status by rank and score line, and push them into the QQ group automatically.
